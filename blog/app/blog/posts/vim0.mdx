Our first meeting happened on September 10, 2024 at the Bergeron Center for Engineering Excellence. 

We were so happy to see each other in person after months of working remotely. We discussed our goals, expectations, and plans for the future. 
We also talked about the challenges we anticipate and how we plan to overcome them.
